## 🌲 The Suicide Forest
A haunting new biome that serves as the heart of the mod's atmosphere.
- **Ambient Horror**: Custom soundscapes that will keep you on edge.
- **The Hanging**: Discover **Hanging Body** entities suspended from the canopy of ancient trees.
- **Looting**: Right-click these grim figures to retrieve **Prime Energy**—the catalyst for everything to come.

## ⚡ Prime Energy & Transformation
Drinking **Prime Energy** isn't just about the rush; it's about the growth.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: As you consume more, your player model (and collision box!) grows wider. 
- **Levels of Power**: Reach Level 5 to become 2.5x wider than a standard player. You might not fit through doors, but you'll be a juggernaut on the field.

## 🎳 Human Bowling: The Rolling Mechanic
Once fueled by Prime Energy, your movement changes forever.
- **Initiate the Roll**: Jumping while under the influence has a high chance to trigger a forced **Roll**.
- **Unstoppable Momentum**: Once you're rolling, you move at high speeds, smashing through blocks and rotating forward with physical force.
- **The Bowling Ball**: Collide with any living entity to deal damage and send them flying with **extreme knockback**.
- **Physics-Defying Bounces**: Take no fall damage! Instead, you'll bounce off the ground or even skip across the surface of water.

## ⚖️ The Struggle
Stopping isn't as easy as starting. 
- **Struggle Bar**: When rolling, a unique GUI appears. You must spam the **Jump** key to fight against the momentum and regain control.
- **High Stakes**: The higher you fall from, the harder it is to "struggle" out of the roll.

**This software is a work of transformative parody and social satire.** 

### 1. Parody and Fair Use
This mod, "Fat People," is protected under the doctrine of **Fair Use** (17 U.S.C. § 107). It utilizes elements of public personas, consumer brands, and historical public controversies specifically to provide commentary, criticism, and satirical humor regarding influencer culture and the intersection of modern consumerism with digital controversy. 

### 2. Transformative Nature
The inclusion of "PRIME Energy" and specific environmental themes is intended to be **transformative**. By placing these elements in a surreal, physics-based Minecraft environment—juxtaposing "Body Positive" advancements with macabre imagery—this work creates a distinct aesthetic and narrative purpose that is entirely separate from the original commercial intent of any referenced brands or persons.

### 3. Non-Affiliation
This project is **not** affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Logan Paul, Congo Brands, the PRIME Energy brand, or any other real-world entity or person referenced. All trademarks and brand names are used solely as the subject of parody and social critique.

### 4. Intent
The intent of this mod is not to promote self-harm, harassment, or brand dilution. It is an artistic expression using dark humor to critique the "shock-value" economy and the public image of modern social media figures. This content is intended for mature audiences who understand the context of satire.

### 5. Disclaimer of Liability
The creator of this mod is not responsible for any offense taken or for the misuse of this software. By downloading this mod, you acknowledge its status as a parody and its satirical nature.
